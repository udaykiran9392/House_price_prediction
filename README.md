# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

🎯 **Objective**: Predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities using regression models.

In the Current Evolving World of Technology , ML has become a booming powerful technology tool to slove the various real-world challenges . From , those it is one of the familier problem of predicting out the price of House . The ability to forecast property values can immensely benefit real estate agents, homeowners, and buyers. Here, we solve it with the linear regression algorithm to predict house sale prices accurately using python. Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In the context of house price prediction, the dependent variable will be the house price, and the independent variables can be factors like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

## 🔍 Overview

This project applies supervised machine learning to predict the selling price of houses. It involves **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model building**, and **evaluation** to provide accurate price predictions — an essential tool for real estate businesses, agents, and buyers.



## 🧠 Steps Followed

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Loaded real estate dataset containing various property attributes.

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Analyzed data distribution, correlation matrix, and feature relevance.

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, normalized numerical features.

4. **Model Training**  
   - Trained multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)
   - Used cross-validation and RMSE/MAE for evaluation

5. **Model Evaluation & Visualization**
