# House_price_prediction

In the Current Evolving World of Technology , ML has become a booming powerful technology tool to slove the various real-world challenges . From , those it is one of the familier problem of predicting out the price of House . The ability to forecast property values can immensely benefit real estate agents, homeowners, and buyers. Here, we solve it with the linear regression algorithm to predict house sale prices accurately using python. Linear regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm in machine learning. It aims to establish a linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In the context of house price prediction, the dependent variable will be the house price, and the independent variables can be factors like the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc. 


House Price Prediction with Linear Regression Involves Following Steps:


1.Data Set collection

2.Data Preprocessing

3.Splitting the dataset

4.Building the Model

5.Model Evaluation

6.Fine-Tuning The Model

7.Deployment and prediction

Which Helps out to use various libraries & other for Solving to show the predicted value .


**Conclusion**

Linear regression is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be applied to predict house prices accurately. By gathering and preprocessing relevant data, building and fine-tuning the model, and evaluating its performance, we can develop a valuable tool for the real estate industry. As technology advances further, machine learning models like linear regression continue to transform the way we make decisions, turning data into meaningful insights for a better future
